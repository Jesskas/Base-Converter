# Base-Converter
Binary-Decimal-Hexadecimal converter for both Android and iOS.
</br><b>NOTE:</b> The name was changed from BinDecHexMobileApps on 11/04/15. Hopefully no related errors arise.

Personal project for my Android phone and my iOS tablet. Works well, somewhat. </br>

<b>Plans:</b>
- Add method of taking signed number into account as well as unsigned.
- Rename the repository effectively as this is no longer specifically a mobile app project.
- Add an Octal section as well for completion.
- Lower version requirements for both Android and iOS to work on most OS versions dating to 2011-ish onwards.
